// Either should be fine for client development until some changes are needed for the server, then the deployed server won't work correctly anymore until it gets rebuilt

// To use one API or the other, comment out one API and uncomment the other

export const API = 'https://orca-app-vwaxr.ondigitalocean.app'
// export const API = 'http://localhost:8000'
